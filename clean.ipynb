The movie has a satirical premise with lots of comedian cameos and a loosely reality based success story of the kelloggs staple procuct pop tarts. The story or premise are never the focal point, just elements to start sketch like scenes with over the top acting and comedic lines. The sketches however are never very funny, the few celebrity cameos kind of fall flat and the overthetopness never reaches absurdities warranting so bad that its good status. I was not expecting a bee movie type landing on your feet happenstance but i was hoping for it after the trailer made it look like there was quality comedy involved yet the movie started out weak. But no real saving grace to be found here. Just very mediocre, very flat and unfunny."
